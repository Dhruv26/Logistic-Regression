# Logistic-Regression
This is a logistic regression model created by Dhruv Segat. It creates the model and fits the data in the txt file with the model.
It was a personal project that I did after finishing a machine learning course on coursera. The given data is taken from the book
"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems".
